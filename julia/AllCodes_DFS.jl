"""
Iterate through all possible binary matrices of size (n, r) one row at a time,
with early termination based on row compatibility checks.

Parameters:
- n: number of rows
- r: number of columns
- verify_fn: function(matrix, current_row) that returns true if rows 1:current_row are compatible

The verify function receives the partial matrix and the index of the row just added.
Return false to skip all matrices that extend this partial configuration.
